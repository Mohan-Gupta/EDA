# EDA on Titanic Data-Set
<img src="..\Figures\Titanic.jpg">
In This Project, I will do Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic DataSet<br>
In the Jupyter Notebook you can find the code and the detailed exploration of dataset.<br>
Here are some of the results of my analysis
<img src="Null Data viz.png">
Around 77% data is null in Cabin and 20% data is null in Age Column.<br>
<img src="AgeDist">
We can see that most of the passengers were between the age 20-40.<br>
<img src="GenderSurvHeatmap.png">
Most of the Male Passengers around 83.70% could not survive while 42.03% children could not survive<br>
<img src="FamilyMembers.png">
For Passengers with 1-3 Family Members the ratio to Survived and Not Survived is higher while<br>For others this
 ratio Not Survived to Survived is higher<br>
 <img src="ClassSurvHeatmap.png">
 Majority of the Passengers of Class 2 and 3 could not survive<br>
 <img src="EmbarkBar.png">
 Ratio of Survived to Not Survived is higher only for the passengers who embarked from Cherbourg
 
 <br><br>If you like my Analysis than do give this repo a star.

## Context
Ray Kroc wanted to build a restaurant system that would be famous for providing food of consistently high quality and uniform methods of preparation.<br>
He wanted to serve burgers, buns, fries and beverages that tasted just the same in Alaska as they did in Alabama. To achieve this, he chose a unique path:<br>
persuading both franchisees and suppliers to buy into his vision, working not for McDonald’s but for themselves, together with McDonald’s. Many of McDonald’s<br>
most famous menu items – like the Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, and Egg McMuffin – were created by franchisees.

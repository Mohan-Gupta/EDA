In This Project, I have done Exploratory Data Analysis on MS dhoni's ODI Batting Career<br>
For visualization I have used Plotly in this Project.<br>
In the Jupyter Notebook you can find the code and the detailed exploration of dataset.<br>
Here are some of the results of my analysis.<br><br>

It can be seen that most of the times he has scored runs between 0-60,<br>
This is due to the reason that he has batted at 4th to 6th position in his career,<br>
Also when he came early to bat he has scored some 100s and also converted those 100s to 150s and more.<br><br>

<img src="https://github.com/Mohan-Gupta/EDA/blob/main/MS%20Dhoni/Plots/How%20Got%20Out%20(Pie%20Chart).png">
46.5% of times he got caught in his ODI career while remained not out for 28.3% of the times.<br><br>

Hence, it can be observed his favourite teams(on the basis of runs scored) are Sri Lanka, Australia and England as opponent<br>
Against some teams he has not scored too many runs cause he has not played a lot of games against them<br><br>

Although he has scored highest runs against Sri Lanka<br> 
However, he has scored highest runs on Shere Bangla National Stadium in Bangladesh.<br><br>

He has got a descent Strike Rate against all these teams with Highest against West Indies.<br><br>
